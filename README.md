# Protocol Buffers Filter

The [pbf](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/ninchat/pbf) Go package implements an
interpreter for a custom bytecode format.  A bytecode program defines a filter
for a [Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers)
(protobuf) message type.  It can be successively applied to protobuf message
data, yielding boolean results.  The filtering step is designed to be fast,
with no memory allocations.

The application doing the filtering doesn't need any prior information about
the specific message types, as the bytecode includes all necessary details.  In
other words, the application doesn't need to include code generated by the
protobuf compiler.

Conversely, when constructing the bytecode program, message type information is
necessary.  The [field](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/ninchat/pbf/field) and
[op](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/ninchat/pbf/op) Go packages, and the
[pbf](pbf.py) Python module contain definitions helpful to bytecode generators,
but comprehensive program construction tools are not provided by this project.

The test code includes a [bytecode program example](bytecode_test.go).
